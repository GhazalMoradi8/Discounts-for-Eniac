# Discounts-for-Eniac
This teamwork project was completed as part of the Data Analyst Intensive Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The objective was to analyze data and provide insights to help Eniac decide whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.
## Summary
The Marketing Team Lead of Eniac is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
However, the main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.

So, regarding the mentioned sitiation the obejetive of this case study to provide insights base on analysing datasets to ansewr the foloowing key questions:
How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
How many products are being discounted?
How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
How could data collection be improved?

The final deliverable of this case study was a 5 minute presentation that you may find in this repository as "Final_Presentation".

## Languages and Libraries Used
For this project, we primarily used Python for data analysis and visualization. The following libraries were utilized:
_ Pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning
_ Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

## Challenges Overcame
One of the main challenges we faced was dealing with corrupted data. Before we could proceed with our analysis, we had to clean the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. This preprocessing step was crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our insights.
