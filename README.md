# Are discounts beneficial for Eniac?
This teamwork project was completed as part of the Data Analyst Intensive Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The objective was to analyze data and provide insights to help Eniac decide whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.
## Summary
The Marketing Team Lead of the Eniac is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run by improving customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention, and allowing the company to grow.
However, the main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.

So, regarding the above-mentioned situation the objective of this case study was to provide insights based on analyzing datasets to answer the following key question:

_What should Eniac's strategy be concerning discounts?_

The final deliverable of this case study was a 5-minute presentation that you may find in this repository as "Final_Presentation".

## Languages and Libraries Used
We primarily used **Python** for data analysis and visualization. The following libraries were utilized:
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization

We also used **Canva** to prepare our final presentation.

## Key Learnings
**Data Cleaning** – One of the most important aspects of our project was handling corrupted data. We learned how to clean, preprocess, and structure datasets to ensure accurate analysis.

**Data Visualization** – Using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we created meaningful visualizations to uncover insights and effectively communicate our findings.

## Challenges Overcame
One of the main challenges we faced was dealing with corrupted data. Before we could proceed with our analysis, we had to clean the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. This preprocessing step was crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our insights.
